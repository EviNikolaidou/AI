# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
This is a group coursework with recommended 3 to 4 students in each group. 40% of mark is awarded for group work around selecting a dataset, identifying question(s) to answer using the dataset, comparing the results from machine learning models developed as part of individual work and drawing on conclusions. 60% of mark is awarded for individual work around building and evaluating a machine learning model to answer the question(s) identified during the group work.

## Assessment Details:
For this coursework you are required to find a dataset, formulate one or several questions you want to answer with this dataset, build and evaluate machine learning models that would address the question(s) (one model by each student), and draw conclusions and recommendations based on your findings.

This is a group coursework with recommended 3 to 4 students in each group. It is your responsibility to find your team members.

There are two deliverables:
1) Presentation (20%);
2) Project report with attached dataset and Python code (80%).

For each of these deliverables, you are required to submit one item on behalf of the group, i.e. one presentation and one zip-archive containing project report, dataset and Python code. Your presentation, report and Python code should clearly list all the contributors (i.e. team members).

Your presentation should be in a form of executive summary lasting for 5-7 min with every team member speaking. Recommended length for report is 4,000 words excluding figures and tables.

Each student will receive an individual mark based on their team contribution (40%) and individual work (60%).

**Team work includes the following tasks:**

1. find a suitable dataset;
2. perform initial analysis and visualisation of the dataset;
3. formulate one or several questions you would like to answer with this dataset;
4. collate results from individual models (see ‘Individual work’ below) and compare results;
5. draw conclusion and recommendations based on the results and insights obtained during individual and group work.

**Individual work includes:**
1. select and justify with references an appropriate machine learning algorithm to employ in your model that would address the question(s) identified by your group; each team member should use a different algorithm (or at least its different settings/parameters; no repetition is allowed);
2. pre-process data and prepare features according to the requirements of your chosen algorithm;
3. build, train and evaluate a machine learning model using the algorithm of your choice;
4. summarise and visualise results to feed back to your group for comparison and conclusions.
